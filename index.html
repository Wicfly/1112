        <p>I remember when we were in Central Park together at the beginning of the semester... I was staring at this bouquet of flowers and I was so lost in thought. I couldn't help but think of your smiling face, and the time when you ate the food I cooked. I was so happy at that time. I remembered when we were together in Chinatown. Haha, I was really jealous. I admit it. I remember you trying different hats in front of me. I remember you grinning with that gold chain in the Halloween costume store. I was really worried when you didn't come to class that Friday. I really wanted to see you at that time. You said that I only asked you out when I wanted to play with you, but that wasn't true. I also remember that I was at Taco Bell and you went to get Starbucks. You were walking on the road and I was so cute that I couldn't help but take out my phone to take a photo, and you found me. Haha. Of course, I will always remember that sunset in Brooklyn. I hope time will always be frozen at that moment.</p>
